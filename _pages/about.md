I'm a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University working making machine learning more trustworthy for healthcare and other high-stakes settings. I am advised by Dr. Suchi Saria, and I also work closely with Dr. Anqi Liu and Dr. Chien-Ming Huang.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree at Yale University with a B.S. in computer science and math and as a Yale Global Health Scholar. At Yale, I worked with Dr. Nicholas Christakis and with Dr. Mark Gerstein.
