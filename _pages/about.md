I'm a second-year Computer Science PhD student at Johns Hopkins University working on making machine learning more trustworthy for healthcare and other high-stakes settings. I develop methods for reliable uncertainty quantification black-box machine-learning predictions in practical settings and study how AI/ML systems can be optimized for human-machine teaming in healthcare. 

I am advised by [Dr. Suchi Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/), and I also work closely with [Dr. Anqi Liu](https://anqiliu-ai.github.io/) and [Dr. Chien-Ming Huang](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~cmhuang/).

Previously at Yale University, I completed my B.S. (with distinction) in computer science and mathematics and was a Yale Global Health Scholar. While at Yale, I worked with Dr. Nicholas Christakis at the [Yale Human Nature Lab](https://humannaturelab.net/) and with Dr. Mark Gerstein in the [Gerstein Lab](http://www.gersteinlab.org/).
