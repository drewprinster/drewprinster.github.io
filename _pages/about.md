I'm a second-year Computer Science PhD student at Johns Hopkins University working on trustworthy machine learning for healthcare and other high-stakes settings. I develop methods for reliable uncertainty quantification of black-box machine-learning predictions for practical use cases and study how AI/ML systems can be optimized for human-machine teaming in healthcare. I am advised by [Dr. Suchi Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/), and I also work closely with [Dr. Anqi Liu](https://anqiliu-ai.github.io/) and [Dr. Chien-Ming Huang](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~cmhuang/).

Previously at Yale University, I completed my B.S. (with distinction) in computer science and mathematics and was a Yale Global Health Scholar. At Yale I contributed to global health volunteering and research with the nonprofit [Unite For Sight](https://uniteforsight.org/); to microbiome, mental health, and social-network research with Dr. Nicholas Christakis at the [Yale Human Nature Lab](https://humannaturelab.net/); and to statistical testing of metagenome alignments with Dr. Mark Gerstein in the [Gerstein Lab](http://www.gersteinlab.org/).
